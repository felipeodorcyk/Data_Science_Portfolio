Biologist, with MSc and PhD in the Neuroscience field. During this time I participated in all stages of scientific research, especially seeking relevant questions
and finding the best way to respond with data. With the intention of migrating to the Data Science field, in 2020 I started to study programing languages such as SQL and Python. Currently, I am enrolled in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence specialization program at PUCRS.

## Background
* Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, seaborn, plotly)

See [Python algorithmic exercises](https://github.com/felipeodorcyk/Codility_Python_Exercises) and [Python Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://github.com/felipeodorcyk/Tic_Tac_Toe_Python)!

* SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

* SPSS

## Projects
* [PhD Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32304750/)

In short, in my PhD research I worked with a disease called neonatal hypoxia ischemia, which is a kind of neonatal brain stroke. We performed PET scan neuroimaging during the first days post-injury (neonatal period) and used regression techniques to show the potential of brain imaging for predicting brain damage and cognitive deficits observed in adulthood.

* [Churn Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/github/felipeodorcyk/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/TelecomUsers.ipynb)

Techniques : EDA, Handling of unbalanced dataset, cross-validation, classification algorithms, model optimization.

* [History of Alzheimer's disease research told by Natural Languade Processing](https://colab.research.google.com/github/felipeodorcyk/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/AlzheimerDiseaseProject.ipynb)

Techniques: NLP, TF-IDF, Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, Association Rule Learning, DataViz.
